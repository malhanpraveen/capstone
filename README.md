# Cryptogaphically Secured Collision Control Protocol for UAVs

This repository contains code used for the implementation of the Capstone Project by Praveen Malhan, Purushottam Kulkarni, and Ritvik Sachdev who are all graduate students at Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute (JHUISI)

This project revolves around implementing Cryptographically Secured Collision Control Protocols for UAVs based on the existing ADS-B message format

It contains proof of concept exploits for existing ADS-B and 802.11 implementations and will contain code for mitigation in the future
